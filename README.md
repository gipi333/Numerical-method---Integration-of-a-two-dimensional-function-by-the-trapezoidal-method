# Numerical-method---Integration-of-a-two-dimensional-function-by-the-trapezoidal-method



The file trapezoid_method.f95 contain a function integre_2(f, a, b, c, d, n, m) which, for a function f(x, y), will return the value of the integral of f on the domain [a, b] × [c, d] computed by the generalized trapezoid method.
 
After that, I use this function to evaluate the primitive F(x, y) = Z Z [y cos (πx) + x cos (πy)] dydx for values of (x, y) ∈ [-5, 5], in order to reconstruct the graph.
